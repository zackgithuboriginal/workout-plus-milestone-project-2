### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

1. [Bootstrap 4.1.3:](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/)
  - Bootstrap was used to create the initial base template of the design that was then built on top of and customised further using CSS.
  
2. [Google Fonts:](https://fonts.google.com/)
  - Google fonts was used to import the fonts that were used as the primary typography on the website.
  
3. [Font Awesome:](https://fontawesome.com/)
  - Font Awesome's icon library was used to reinforce sections and information points throughout the website.
  
4. [jQuery:](https://jquery.com/)
  - Bootstrap's jQuery library is in use on the website to increase the functionality of some Bootstrap components.
  
5. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
  - Git was used as the primary version control software for the project. It was operated using the Gitpod terminal.
  
6. [GitHub:](https://github.com/)
  - GitHub is where the project is stored. It was also used to view version control changes.
  
7. [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/)
  - Gitpod was the IDE used to program the website.
  
8. [Coolors](https://coolors.co/)
  - Coolors was used to generate colours for a scheme that was harmonious and evoked the desired aesthetic.
  
9. [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
  - Figma was used to generate the initial wireframes and mockups that were used to inform the programming of the website.

10. [Responsive Viewer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/responsive-viewer/inmopeiepgfljkpkidclfgbgbmfcennb?hl=en)
  - This chrome web extension was used as it allows for multiple views of a website at multiple scales and device sizes at once. It was used for testing of responsive design.
  
12. [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools)
 - DevTools was used for analysing the code and design of the practice during development. Also used to test changes in real-time.
 
 ### Testing

I tested the website thoroughly, throughout development I would ensure that it looked and behaved as designed and laid out in the wireframes. The website was tested at multiple scales, through desktop and mobile devices with no bugs or issues remaining in the deployed version.
The website was viewed and tested through the following browsers and devices:

- [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/)

- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_ie/chrome/)

- [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge)

- [Opera](https://www.opera.com/)

- A full range of sizes and devices using Chrome DevTools and [Responsive Viewer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/responsive-viewer/inmopeiepgfljkpkidclfgbgbmfcennb?hl=en)

At the end of the project, the code was put through CSS and HTML validators to ensure there were no errors presented.
-   [Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) - [HTML Testing Results]()
-   [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) - [CSS Testing Results]()
