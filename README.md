# Workout Plus - Milestone Project 2

![Image of Landing Page](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/workout-plus-milestone-project-2/blob/master/assets/images/multi-screen-display.PNG)

## Website Description
This website contains a web application that offers the ability to connect visitors and users with Gyms and Exercise Centres either nearby to their location or around a desired location. The web application uses a suite of Google APIs to provide a map display and make use of the Places database and autocomplete search feature to display the locations and retrieve their details and ensure a more accurate user friendly search experience.
The Gym Search feature offers two search options to the user, the first to select their desired country and then enter an address in the field that will autocomplete and offer suggestions and predictions and the second is to use the Device location search which uses the HTML geolocation API to read the device’s location and then initiates a map search on that location.
The purpose of the website is to connect visitors with potential exercise locations as easily and conveniently as possible within a space that could be expanded to provide a more comprehensive workout planner service in the future.
## User Experience / UX
### User stories

#### 1.	Discern the purpose and function of the website.

#### 2.	Navigate and explore website.

#### 3.	Find and understand how to use the map search.

#### 4.	Identify potential new workout locations in a specific area.

#### 5. Identify potential new workout locations around their location.

#### 6.	Select a location and access contact information for it.

#### 7.	Search through potential locations comparing ratings.

#### 8. Search a location that does not appear using the autocomplete results.

#### 9. Prioritise a search country to get more accurate results.

### Design

#### Design Overview
The main principles behind the design of the website was to create a space that was easy to navigate, that offered clear and easy to understand information and easy to use. The driving force behind the design was my desire to create a website that melded high energy colour and imagery with clear and legible information and an immediately understandable structure.
#### Colour Scheme
The colour scheme is quite simple, essentially consisting of only three colours. The primary colour, which is used frequently throughout the design is #F39237. This is a very strong and eye-catching colour that conveys the sense of energy and activity that I wanted to associate with the website. I believe that by using an energetic colour in this manner it will help to build the identity of the website as well as subconsciously create a link between the website and the energetic activities involved in exercising in the mind of any visitor to the site. The other two colours in use are #F9F9F9 and #1E3231, and they used for accent and contrasting purposes. #1E3231 is a shade of dark – grey navy and I find that it stands out quite well against both the white background of certain sections and the reduced opacity #F39237 which is used as a background colour in other sections. #1E3231 is therefore used as the primary font colour for most instances of text on the website as I believe it to be more comfortable and easy on the eyes than a typical black font colour. #F9F9F9 is an offwhite shade that is used as a text colour for navbar elements and any links or CTA buttons. Reserving this colour only for actionable elements helps a visitor to understand the navigation and structure of the site more quickly and easily as they can identify clickable links just through their colour.

#### Typography
There are two fonts used in the website. The first, Montserrat is a very minimal and clean font and is used for the navigation options and important headings. The second font used is Raleway and is used for information paragraphs, I chose this font for this function because I consider it to be a very readable font and it allows for fast legibility and information digestion. I intentionally used two separate fonts for these functions in order to enable a user to discern the content and importance of text from a quick scan and allow a user to intuit and learn the structure of the website more easily than they would have been able to if the website used only one font type.
#### Imagery
There are not a lot of images used in the design of the website. The most notable example, however, is the background image of the landing page. This is an energetic image of a man in the process of working out. This image I believe is very effective at setting the tone and further reinforcing the theme and purpose of the website alongside the name and general branding. This image ties in with the theming of the design well, evoking high energy but by overlaying a low opacity screen on it does not overpower the page.
Additionally, whenever a user selects a gym on the map, an image of the gym is supplied in the additional information section. Using JavaScript I was able to access the photos attached to the location in the Google Places Library, and then loop through the images until one with a suitable landscape orientation was encountered. This image is then be displayed alongside the other location details and with the screening process, the layout and display of information would be consistent and clear while clicking between different locations. I believe that this was necessary to not only maintain the neat display of information but to provide a pleasurable experience to the user, as they clicked through different gyms to compare their details and appearance.
In the event that a location did not have any images associated with it in the Google Places Library or that it did not have any available images in the correct orientation. A simple placeholder image is used. This image, created by me, contains the text “No Image Available” with a background colour of #F39237 to maintain the site’s consistent theme while also informing the user for the reason that no image is displayed as I believe that this provides a better user experience than just displaying a blank space.

### Wireframes

The wireframes for the website were developed using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)

## Features

### Landing Page

![Image of Landing Page](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/workout-plus-milestone-project-2/blob/master/assets/images/landing-page.jpg)
The landing page is the user's first introduction to the site and as such it was important to not only provide information that will inform the user about the purpose and functionality of the website but to set the tone of the website and to start to instill the identity of the website onto the user. The landing page therefore contains three primary elements. A large eye catching callout with a CTA button that links to the gym finder application. A text section containing information about the website and explaining some of how the gym finder application works and a large hero image in the background of a man in the middle of working out that helps to set the tone of the website and create a sense of energy and activity.

### Gym Finder Page

![Image of Gym Search Feature](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/workout-plus-milestone-project-2/blob/master/assets/images/gym-finder-application.png)
The most important feature of the site is the gym finder page. The gym finder application allows a user to search a desired location for gyms and other businesses related to exsercise and fitness. It visually displays the results on a map that is powered by the Google Maps API, with the 20 nearest locations displayed with custom markers. These markers can be selected to bring up the name of the location on the map, and on the sidebar to the left of the page an information window will open with more extensive details including the address, location rating and website along with an image of the location.

### Autocomplete Search
![Image of an autocomplete search](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/workout-plus-milestone-project-2/blob/master/assets/images/autocomplete.PNG)

The autocomplete search utilises the Google Place Autocomplete API. It reads any string typed into the text input field and turns that into an autocomplete request. The results are limited to addresses to streamline the experience for the user rather than allow for businesses and other locations to fill up the prediction options. Using the country selection dropdown input which contains a full list of countries it is possible for a user to select a specific country in which they want to search. After selecting a country the only predictions suggested to users will be located within that country. This allows for much more accurate autocomplete suggestions, and again improves the user experience of the feature.

### Geocode Search
![Image of an autocomplete search](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/workout-plus-milestone-project-2/blob/master/assets/images/geocode.PNG)

The geocode search uses a Google Geocode API request. If a user decides to hit enter or to click the button to submit their text input, the string will be sent in a Geocoder request and be returned as a lat, lng coordinate that is then used to center the map on the location where the gym search will be carried out. As with the autocomplete search it is possible to specify a country to search in, however in the case of the geocoder search it only biases the result and if no location within the specified country is found it will default to a global search. Using a country specific search increases the accuracy of the search.

### Device Geolocation Search
![Image of an autocomplete search](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/workout-plus-milestone-project-2/blob/master/assets/images/geolocation.PNG)

The geolocation search uses the Web Geolocation API to first request from the user permission to use their location and if they user approves it will use their device's functionality to provide a location for them. The result of this search again contains lat, lng coordinates which are used to center the map with great accuracy. This method of searching is the most covenient for searching in the immediate local area of the user as it's not necessary to know any addresses in order to search.

### Map Results Display 
![Image of an autocomplete search](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/workout-plus-milestone-project-2/blob/master/assets/images/map-results.PNG)

The results of the search are displayed as so, with orange markers on the map. Each of these markers represent a gym or similar location around the radius of the search location. To provide a good selection of results without overloading the map, only the closest 20 locations are displayed. If a user selects one of these markers a small window will pop up above the marker with the location's name. As well as that a side panel below the search input section will open and display further details about the location.

### Side Panel Results Display 
![Image of an autocomplete search](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/workout-plus-milestone-project-2/blob/master/assets/images/example-gym-result.PNG)

After a marker is selected on the map a display opens beneath the search options. This panel will display important information about the location selected to help the user make their decision to enable them to conduct further research and more effectively compare their options. As is visible above, in order to provide accurate information and consistent feedback to the user, if a location does not have value for a certain property in the Google Place database a pre determined placeholder response will display. In the case above the location had no affiliated website, so the gym finder application notifies the user as such instead of leaving the space blank or allowing the previous location's information to persist and cause confusion.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

#### 1.	Goal: Discern the purpose and function of the website.

**Expected:** When the user accesses the website for the first time they should be presented with information about the website and the web application.

**Result:** When the user arrives at the landing page they are presented with a text paragraph giving an overview of the purpose for the website and the functionality of the web application.

![Image of landing page information](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/workout-plus-milestone-project-2/blob/master/assets/images/landing-info.PNG)

#### 2.	Goal: Navigate and explore the website.

**Expected:** Wherever the user is on the website they should be able to immediately identify and locate the navigation structure for the website.

**Result:** At all times the navigation bar is fixed at the top of the screen providing clear navigation opportunities to the user.

![Image of the navbar](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/workout-plus-milestone-project-2/blob/master/assets/images/navbar.PNG)

#### 3.	Goal: Find and understand how to use the gym search application.

**Expected:**
1.	Upon loading landing page, user should be presented with clear navigation options to gym search application.
2.	User should then find gym search application and easily understand how to use it.

**Result:**
1.	When landing page is accessed, there is a clear navigation option “Gym Search” at the top of the page. There is also a large CTA button in the page heading. Both of these options will navigate the user directly to the gym search page.
2.	On the gym search page the user is presented with a number of clear input options with labels and example search options of “Ireland” and “Dublin” as placeholders. The map by default is centred on this location to provide the user with an example search result.

![Image of the search options](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/workout-plus-milestone-project-2/blob/master/assets/images/search-interface.PNG)

#### 4.	Goal: Identify potential new workout locations in a specific area..

**Expected:** The user should be able to enter their desired address or area and submit. They should then be presented with a selection of potential locations around that area.

**Result:** The user can enter their desired address, they will then be presented with autocomplete options. When the user selects an option the map will navigate to that spot and display markers on the map representing identified locations. 

![Image of the map results](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/workout-plus-milestone-project-2/blob/master/assets/images/map-results.PNG)

#### 5.	Goal: Identify potential new workout locations around their location.

**Expected:**  The user should be able to use their device's location to search the map quickly and conveniently.

**Result:** The user can click the "Use device's location" button which will then send a request to the user to allow permission to use their device's location. When they accept, the map will navigate to their device's location and display results.

![Image of the geolocation request](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/workout-plus-milestone-project-2/blob/master/assets/images/geolocation.PNG)

#### 6.	Select a location and access contact information for it.

**Expected:** The user should be able to submit a search and then click on any of the displayed locations to access information for them. 

**Result:** After submitting a desired search location the user is presented with 20 potential locations marked on the map. When the user clicks on any of the markers the application will display a window containing important information regarding the location.

![Image of location details](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/workout-plus-milestone-project-2/blob/master/assets/images/example-gym-result.PNG)

#### 7.	Goal: Search through potential locations comparing ratings.

**Expected:** The user should be able to click on multiple markers to compare rating information for them.

**Result:** The user can click on a marker which will then display the information for that gym. They can then either close their selection using the "x" and click a new marker or they can simply click on a new marker to overwrite the existing information to view the new results.

**Issue:** Some locations do not have rating information available through the Google Places Library which results in the previous location’s rating persisting incorrectly.

**Fix:** Upon clicking on a new location, a check is done to determine whether the location has a rating attribute. If it does not have a rating available the website now provides a “No available rating” message to ensure accurate feedback for the user.

![Image of the alternate rating response](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/workout-plus-milestone-project-2/blob/master/assets/images/rating.PNG)

#### 8. Search a location that does not appear using the autocomplete results.

**Expected:** The user should be able to search for more general areas such as "London" or "East London" and not have to find the exact address to search.

**Result:** The user can enter their desired location and hit submit. The application will use a geocoder search to convert their address to coordinates and navigate the map to that location.

![Image of the geolocation request](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/workout-plus-milestone-project-2/blob/master/assets/images/geocode.PNG)

#### 9. Prioritise a search country to get more accurate results.

**Expected:** The user should be able to narrow down the search area to a country to guarantee a more accurate result.

**Result:** The user can select any country from the dropdown list. Both the autocomplete search and the address search will then restrict the results to locations within the chosen country when possible.

![Image of the dropdown country selection](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/workout-plus-milestone-project-2/blob/master/assets/images/country-search.PNG)
